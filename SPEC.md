# Analytics Context Format (ACF) — v0.1

The on-disk format the interview produces and the harness reads. It is plain
Markdown + YAML in a git repo, so the review surface is a pull request and the
change-trigger is a GitHub Action.

ACF deliberately separates **three audiences**:

| File kind | Written for | Optimized for |
|---|---|---|
| `context.md`, `overview.md`, `terminology.md` | humans | onboarding, narrative, "why" |
| `reference.md` | the agent at query time | retrieval: routing triggers, gotchas, grain, query patterns |
| `*.yaml` (entities, metrics, domain) | both + CI | machine-validatable structured facts |

This split is the main upgrade over a single narrative doc. The `reference.md` is
the file the agent actually reads to answer a question, and it is written for an
LLM, not a person — explicit `IF … DO NOT …` routing, grain, exclusions, and
wrong-answer modes, with no prose it has to wade through.

## Design rules (these are load-bearing)

1. **A human owns every definition.** The model may draft; a person confirms. Any
   field marked `status: draft` is excluded from the "perfect" eval baseline until
   confirmed.
2. **No statistics in context.** Notes are qualitative business logic ("exclude
   BHPN — different reimbursement cycle"), never "~37% of sessions." Numbers go
   stale; business logic doesn't. 
3. **Context is separate from lineage, but never *unlinked* from it.** Every
   domain, entity, and metric carries a `lineage:` pointer (repo + path + ref) so
   drift detection can fire when the upstream model changes. Separation is for
   enterprises with many pipelines; the pointer is what keeps separation safe.
4. **Every confirmed disambiguation emits an eval seed.** The interview writes
   `evals/seeds/*.yaml` as a byproduct. These are the ground truth the delta is
   measured against.
5. **Everything is CI-checkable.** Each YAML kind has a JSON Schema in `schemas/`.
   A PR that breaks the schema fails review.

## Query patterns — the one narrow allowance for SQL in context

Context files carry business logic, not a query library — but a domain's
`reference.md` MAY include a small `## Common query patterns` section with fenced
`sql` blocks, **only where the exact query form is the hard-won knowledge**: the
join path, dedup, or mandatory clause that makes the obvious query silently wrong.
(Distilled, curated patterns are the useful residue of query history; raw query
retrieval, measured head-to-head, moves accuracy by less than a point. The pattern
is curation, not history.)

The line, precisely:

- **Pattern, not paste.** Real model/column names are welcome — they are already
  context. Literal parameter values are not: use `<placeholders>`. A pattern
  encodes a *form*; it is never a complete runnable report.
- **Each pattern names the failure it prevents** in one leading `Without this:`
  line. If no wrong-answer mode can be named, it is an example, not a pattern —
  leave it out.
- **Human-confirmed, like everything else** (design rule 1). Unconfirmed patterns
  carry `<!-- status: draft -->` and are excluded like any other draft.
- **Bounded.** A handful per domain — this is not a query library. Runnable,
  blessed SQL lives only in the gitignored `evals/verified/` sidecar (below),
  never committed.
- **Distilled, never mined.** Never copied from query logs or history; a pattern
  earns its place through the interview or a Stage-5 verified match.
- **Drift-covered.** A pattern references only models listed in the domain's
  `lineage:`, so upstream drift re-flags it for re-confirmation with the rest of
  the domain. A one-line dialect note (e.g. divide-by-zero handling) may
  accompany a pattern when the trap is dialect-specific.

Placement rule:
**cross-domain entity** (lives in a `dim_*` table or spans fact tables) →
`entities/`; **domain-specific status/type** (one fact table, one owner) →
`domains/<domain>/entities.yaml`.

## Where a domain comes from

A domain in ACF maps to **how the company already thinks about a slice of the
business — usually a cluster of dashboards.** The interview discovers domains by
asking which dashboards exist and who owns them, then treats each coherent cluster
as a domain. This is why `domain.yaml` carries a `dashboards:` list: a dashboard
cluster is the unit of "a line of business or function," and it's also the richest
source of eval seeds (the questions those dashboards answer are real questions).

## File: `context.config.yaml` (the drift seam)

The one file that makes "context lives apart from lineage" safe. It maps each
domain to its upstream lineage source(s), so a change there can flag stale context.
See [`template/context.config.yaml`](./template/context.config.yaml).

**Multiple warehouses / clouds.** The top-level `warehouse:` is the repo-wide
*default*. Each `lineage_sources` entry may carry its own `warehouse:` (snowflake |
bigquery | …) when a company's domains span platforms; an entry without one inherits
the default. A source's effective platform is `source.warehouse ?? top-level
warehouse`. There is **no per-domain warehouse field** — a domain's platform is
derived from whichever sources its `lineage:` references. A single domain whose
models live on two platforms simply lists one lineage entry per source (the array
already supports this); don't invent a federated marker. Drift detection must resolve
each source's platform by this rule and diff against that source's manifest/connection.

```yaml
version: 0.1
warehouse: snowflake            # default platform; per-source `warehouse:` overrides it
lineage_sources:
  - id: dbt_snowflake
    type: dbt                   # no `warehouse:` → inherits the default (snowflake)
    repo: github.com/acme/acme-dbt
    ref: main
    manifest_path: target/manifest.json
  - id: dbt_bq_marketing
    type: dbt
    warehouse: bigquery         # this source lives on BigQuery
    repo: github.com/acme/marketing-dbt
    ref: main
    manifest_path: target/manifest.json

  session-financials:

  marketing-attribution:        # platform derived from the source → BigQuery

## YAML kinds (full field lists in `schemas/`)

### entity (`entities/*.yaml`, `domains/*/entities.yaml`)
`name`, `description`, `mappings` (column→value meaning), `analytical_notes`,
`important` (disambiguation), `lineage`, `status` (draft|confirmed).

### metric (`domains/*/metrics.yaml`)
`name`, `definition` (prose, human-owned), `grain`, `parameters` (what the user
must specify), `caveats`, `common_filters`, `lineage`, `status`.

### domain (`domains/*/domain.yaml`)
`name`, `summary`, `tables`, `grain`, `dashboards`, `owner`, `lineage`.

### eval seed (`evals/seeds/*.seed.yaml`)
`question`, `intent` (the disambiguated meaning), `expected` (one of:
`semantic_entity` | `sql_shape` | `value_at_snapshot`), `provenance`
(`interview` | `dashboard` | `correction` | `generated`), `domain`, `status`, and
the optional `verified_query_file` (below). See
[`SPEC` of seeds](./schemas/evalseed.schema.json) and
[harvesting reference](./skills/context-interview/references/eval-seed-harvesting.md).

**Seeds are the one place a number is allowed — but the SQL is never committed.**
Design rule 2 ("no statistics in context") and the pattern-not-paste rule ("Query
patterns", above) govern *context files* — the things the agent reads at query time
(`reference.md`, `metrics.yaml`). A seed is the *ground-truth* layer, not context, so a
`value_at_snapshot` number is allowed in the seed YAML, pinned to an `as_of` date so
it can't masquerade as live truth. The blessed SQL, however, is **deliberately kept
out of git**: SQL goes stale fast and must not be cloneable from a published context
repo, so it lives in a local, gitignored sidecar (`evals/verified/<name>.sql`) and
the committed seed carries only a `verified_query_file` pointer to it.

`verified_query_file` is the relative path to that sidecar — the blessed read-only
SQL whose result the analyst confirmed against a trusted source (a dashboard). It is
written **only on a verified match** by Stage 5 live verification (below) and is the
reusable "answer key" for the seed; the harness reads it locally where present and
degrades to grading `value_at_snapshot` / `sql_shape` where it is absent.

## Live verification (Stage 5) and `evals/runs/`

The interview's [Stage 5](./skills/context-interview/references/live-verification.md)
answers each candidate question twice — once with context off, once on — against the
live warehouse, then has the analyst confirm the on-answer against their dashboard.
A confirmed match upgrades the seed to `provenance: dashboard`,
`expected.kind: value_at_snapshot` (with `value` + `as_of`) and writes the blessed
SQL to the gitignored sidecar `evals/verified/<name>.sql`, pointed to by the seed's
`verified_query_file`. A mismatch is harvested back into the domain's `reference.md` /
`known-issues.md` plus a `provenance: correction` seed. The per-answer agent traces
are written under `evals/runs/<timestamp>/` — these are generated output, not ACF,
and are gitignored in a generated context repo; the durable outputs are the seeds
and the updated context files.

## Versioning

ACF is versioned at the repo root (`context.config.yaml: version`). The harness
declares which ACF versions it supports. Breaking changes bump the minor while
v0.x, the major after 1.0.

## Relationship to other formats

ACF is **one** input to the measurement harness, not a prerequisite. The harness
also reads Kaelio `ktx` (`semantic-layer/*.yaml` + `wiki/*.md`), dbt
(`manifest.json` + `schema.yml` docs), raw markdown, and agent data-analysis
skills (`SKILL.md` + `references/`). See
[`eval_harness/INTERFACE.md`](./eval_harness/INTERFACE.md) for the normalized
intermediate representation all of these map into.
